<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<h2 id="what-is-centrifuge">What is Centrifuge?</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.ccb.jhu.edu/software/centrifuge">Centrifuge</a> is a novel microbial classification engine that enables rapid, accurate, and sensitive labeling of reads and quantification of species on desktop computers. The system uses a novel indexing scheme based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) and the Ferragina-Manzini (FM) index, optimized specifically for the metagenomic classification problem. Centrifuge requires a relatively small index (5.8 GB for all complete bacterial and viral genomes plus the human genome) and classifies sequences at a very high speed, allowing it to process the millions of reads from a typical high-throughput DNA sequencing run within a few minutes. Together these advances enable timely and accurate analysis of large metagenomics data sets on conventional desktop computers.</p>
<h1 id="obtaining-centrifuge">Obtaining Centrifuge</h1>
<p>Download Centrifuge and binaries from the Releases sections on the right side. Binaries are available for Intel architectures (<code>x86_64</code>) running Linux, and Mac OS X.</p>
<h2 id="building-from-source">Building from source</h2>
<p>Building Centrifuge from source requires a GNU-like environment with GCC, GNU Make and other basics. It should be possible to build Centrifuge on most vanilla Linux installations or on a Mac installation with <a href="http://developer.apple.com/xcode/">Xcode</a> installed. Centrifuge can also be built on Windows using <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> or <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a> (MinGW recommended). For a MinGW build the choice of what compiler is to be used is important since this will determine if a 32 or 64 bit code can be successfully compiled using it. If there is a need to generate both 32 and 64 bit on the same machine then a multilib MinGW has to be properly installed. <a href="http://www.mingw.org/wiki/msys">MSYS</a>, the <a href="http://cygwin.com/packages/mingw-zlib/">zlib</a> library, and depending on architecture <a href="http://sourceware.org/pthreads-win32/">pthreads</a> library are also required. We are recommending a 64 bit build since it has some clear advantages in real life research problems. In order to simplify the MinGW setup it might be worth investigating popular MinGW personal builds since these are coming already prepared with most of the toolchains needed.</p>
<p>First, download the [source package] from the Releases secion on the right side. Unzip the file, change to the unzipped directory, and build the Centrifuge tools by running GNU <code>make</code> (usually with the command <code>make</code>, but sometimes with <code>gmake</code>) with no arguments. If building with MinGW, run <code>make</code> from the MSYS environment.</p>
<p>Centrifuge is using the multithreading software model in order to speed up execution times on SMP architectures where this is possible. On POSIX platforms (like linux, Mac OS, etc) it needs the pthread library. Although it is possible to use pthread library on non-POSIX platform like Windows, due to performance reasons Centrifuge will try to use Windows native multithreading if possible.</p>
<p>For the support of SRA data access in HISAT2, please download and install the <a href="https://github.com/ncbi/ngs/wiki/Downloads">NCBI-NGS</a> toolkit. When running <code>make</code>, specify additional variables as follow. <code>make USE_SRA=1 NCBI_NGS_DIR=/path/to/NCBI-NGS-directory NCBI_VDB_DIR=/path/to/NCBI-NGS-directory</code>, where <code>NCBI_NGS_DIR</code> and <code>NCBI_VDB_DIR</code> will be used in Makefile for -I and -L compilation options. For example, $(NCBI_NGS_DIR)/include and $(NCBI_NGS_DIR)/lib64 will be used.</p>
<h1 id="running-centrifuge">Running Centrifuge</h1>
<h2 id="adding-to-path">Adding to PATH</h2>
<p>By adding your new Centrifuge directory to your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)">PATH environment variable</a>, you ensure that whenever you run <code>centrifuge</code>, <code>centrifuge-build</code>, <code>centrifuge-download</code> or <code>centrifuge-inspect</code> from the command line, you will get the version you just installed without having to specify the entire path. This is recommended for most users. To do this, follow your operating system's instructions for adding the directory to your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)">PATH</a>.</p>
<p>If you would like to install Centrifuge by copying the Centrifuge executable files to an existing directory in your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)">PATH</a>, make sure that you copy all the executables, including <code>centrifuge</code>, <code>centrifuge-class</code>, <code>centrifuge-build</code>, <code>centrifuge-build-bin</code>, <code>centrifuge-download</code> <code>centrifuge-inspect</code> and <code>centrifuge-inspect-bin</code>. Furthermore you need the programs in the scripts/ folder if you opt for genome compression in the database construction.</p>
<h2 id="before-running-centrifuge">Before running Centrifuge</h2>
<p>Classification is considerably different from alignment in that classification is performed on a large set of genomes as opposed to on just one reference genome as in alignment. Currently, an enormous number of complete genomes are available at the GenBank (e.g. &gt;4,000 bacterial genomes, &gt;10,000 viral genomes, …). These genomes are organized in a taxonomic tree where each genome is located at the bottom of the tree, at the strain or subspecies level. On the taxonomic tree, genomes have ancestors usually situated at the species level, and those ancestors also have ancestors at the genus level and so on up the family level, the order level, class level, phylum, kingdom, and finally at the root level.</p>
<p>Given the gigantic number of genomes available, which continues to expand at a rapid rate, and the development of the taxonomic tree, which continues to evolve with new advancements in research, we have designed Centrifuge to be flexible and general enough to reflect this huge database. We provide several standard indexes that will meet most of users’ needs (see the side panel - Indexes). In our approach our indexes not only include raw genome sequences, but also genome names/sizes and taxonomic trees. This enables users to perform additional analyses on Centrifuge’s classification output without the need to download extra database sources. This also eliminates the potential issue of discrepancy between the indexes we provide and the databases users may otherwise download. We plan to provide a couple of additional standard indexes in the near future, and update the indexes on a regular basis.</p>
<p>We encourage first time users to take a look at and follow a <a href="#centrifuge-example"><code>small example</code></a> that illustrates how to build an index, how to run Centrifuge using the index, how to interpret the classification results, and how to extract additional genomic information from the index. For those who choose to build customized indexes, please take a close look at the following description.</p>
<h2 id="database-download-and-index-building">Database download and index building</h2>
<p>Centrifuge indexes can be built with arbritary sequences. Standard choices are all of the complete bacterial and viral genomes, or using the sequences that are part of the BLAST nt database. Centrifuge always needs the nodes.dmp file from the NCBI taxonomy dump to build the taxonomy tree, as well as a sequence ID to taxonomy ID map. The map is a tab-separated file with the sequence ID to taxonomy ID map.</p>
<p>To download all of the complete archaeal, viral, and bacterial genomes from RefSeq, and build the index:</p>
<p>Centrifuge indices can be build on arbritary sequences. Usually an ensemble of genomes is used - such as all complete microbial genomes in the RefSeq database, or all sequences in the BLAST nt database.</p>
<p>To map sequence identifiers to taxonomy IDs, and taxonomy IDs to names and its parents, three files are necessary in addition to the sequence files:</p>
<ul>
<li>taxonomy tree: typically nodes.dmp from the NCBI taxonomy dump. Links taxonomy IDs to their parents</li>
<li>names file: typically names.dmp from the NCBI taxonomy dump. Links taxonomy IDs to their scientific name</li>
<li>a tab-separated sequence ID to taxonomy ID mapping</li>
</ul>
<p>When using the provided scripts to download the genomes, these files are automatically downloaded or generated. When using a custom taxonomy or sequence files, please refer to the section <code>TODO</code> to learn more about their format.</p>
<h3 id="building-index-on-all-complete-bacterial-and-viral-genomes">Building index on all complete bacterial and viral genomes</h3>
<p>Use <code>centrifuge-download</code> to download genomes from NCBI. The following two commands download the NCBI taxonomy to <code>taxonomy/</code> in the current directory, and all complete archaeal, bacterial and viral genomes to <code>library/</code>. Low-complexity regions in the genomes are masked after download (parameter <code>-m</code>) using blast+'s <code>dustmasker</code>. <code>centrifuge-download</code> outputs tab-separated sequence ID to taxonomy ID mappings to standard out, which are required by <code>centrifuge-build</code>.</p>
<pre><code>centrifuge-download -o taxonomy taxonomy
centrifuge-download -o library -m -d &quot;archaea,bacteria,viral&quot; refseq &gt; seqid2taxid.map</code></pre>
<p>To build the index, first concatenate all downloaded sequences into a single file, and then run <code>centrifuge-build</code>:</p>
<pre><code>cat library/*/*.fna &gt; input-sequences.fna

## build centrifuge index with 4 threads
centrifuge-build -p 4 --conversion-table seqid2taxid.map \
                 --taxonomy-tree taxonomy/nodes.dmp --name-table taxonomy/names.dmp \
                 input-sequences.fna abv</code></pre>
<p>After building the index, all files except the index *.[123].cf files may be removed. If you also want to include the human and/or the mouse genome, add their sequences to the library folder before building the index with one of the following commands:</p>
<p>After the index building, all but the *.[123].cf index files may be removed. I.e. the files in the <code>library/</code> and <code>taxonomy/</code> directories are no longer needed.</p>
<h3 id="adding-human-or-mouse-genome-to-the-index">Adding human or mouse genome to the index</h3>
<p>The human and mouse genomes can also be downloaded using <code>centrifuge-download</code>. They are in the domain &quot;vertebrate_mammalian&quot; (argument <code>-d</code>), are assembled at the chromosome level (argument <code>-a</code>) and categorized as reference genomes by RefSeq (<code>-c</code>). The argument <code>-t</code> takes a comma-separated list of taxonomy IDs - e.g. <code>9606</code> for human and <code>10090</code> for mouse:</p>
<pre><code># download mouse and human reference genomes
centrifuge-download -o library -d &quot;vertebrate_mammalian&quot; -a &quot;Chromosome&quot; -t 9606,10090 -c &#39;reference genome&#39; &gt;&gt; seqid2taxid.map
# only human
centrifuge-download -o library -d &quot;vertebrate_mammalian&quot; -a &quot;Chromosome&quot; -t 9606 -c &#39;reference genome&#39; &gt;&gt; seqid2taxid.map
# only mouse
centrifuge-download -o library -d &quot;vertebrate_mammalian&quot; -a &quot;Chromosome&quot; -t 10090 -c &#39;reference genome&#39; &gt;&gt; seqid2taxid.map</code></pre>
<h3 id="nt-database">nt database</h3>
<p>NCBI BLAST's nt database contains all spliced non-redundant coding sequences from multiplpe databases, inferred from genommic sequences. Traditionally used with BLAST, a download of the FASTA is provided on the NCBI homepage. Building an index with any database requires the user to creates a sequence ID to taxonomy ID map that can be generated from a GI taxid dump:</p>
<pre><code>wget ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/db/FASTA/nt.gz
gunzip nt.gz &amp;&amp; mv -v nt nt.fa

# Get mapping file
wget ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/gi_taxid_nucl.dmp.gz
gunzip -c gi_taxid_nucl.dmp.gz | sed &#39;s/^/gi|/&#39; &gt; gi_taxid_nucl.map

# build index using 16 cores and a small bucket size, which will require less memory
centrifuge-build -p 16 --bmax 1342177280 --conversion-table gi_taxid_nucl.map \
                 --taxonomy-tree taxonomy/nodes.dmp --name-table taxonomy/names.dmp \ 
                 nt.fa nt</code></pre>
<h3 id="custom-database">Custom database</h3>
<p>TODO: Add toy example for nodes.dmp, names.dmp and seqid2taxid.map</p>
<h3 id="centrifuge-classification-output">Centrifuge classification output</h3>
<p>The following example shows classification assignments for a read. The assignment output has 8 columns.</p>
<pre><code>readID    seqID   taxID score      2ndBestScore    hitLength    queryLength numMatches
1_1       gi|4    9646  4225       0               80   80      1

The first column is the read ID from a raw sequencing read (e.g., 1_1 in the example).
The second column is the sequence ID of the genomic sequence, where the read is classified (e.g., gi|4).
The third column is the taxonomic ID of the genomic sequence in the second column (e.g., 9646).
The fourth column is the score for the classification, which is the weighted sum of hits (e.g., 4225)
The fifth column is the score for the next best classification (e.g., 0).
The sixth column is a pair of two numbers: (1) an approximate number of base pairs of the read that match the genomic sequence and (2) the length of a read or the combined length of mate pairs (e.g., 80 / 80).
The seventh column is a pair of two numbers: (1) an approximate number of base pairs of the read that match the genomic sequence and (2) the length of a read or the combined length of mate pairs (e.g., 80 / 80). 
The eighth column is the number of classifications, indicating how many assignments were made (e.g.,1).</code></pre>
<h3 id="centrifuge-summary-output-the-default-filename-is-centrifuge_report.tsv">Centrifuge summary output (the default filename is centrifuge_report.tsv)</h3>
<p>The following example shows a classification summary for each genome or taxonomic unit. The assignment output has 7 columns.</p>
<pre><code>name                                                            taxID   taxRank    genomeSize   numReads   numUniqueReads   abundance

The first column is the name of a genome, or the name corresponding to a taxonomic ID (the second column) at a rank higher than the strain (e.g., Wigglesworthia glossinidia endosymbiont of Glossina brevipalpis).
The second column is the taxonomic ID (e.g., 36870).
The third column is the taxonomic rank (e.g., leaf).
The fourth column is the length of the genome sequence (e.g., 703004).
The fifth column is the number of reads classified to this genomic sequence including multi-classified reads (e.g., 5981).
The sixth column is the number of reads uniquely classified to this genomic sequence (e.g., 5964).
The seventh column is the proportion of this genome normalized by its genomic length (e.g., 0.0152317).</code></pre>
<h2 id="inspecting-the-centrifuge-index">Inspecting the Centrifuge index</h2>
<p>The index can be inspected with <code>centrifuge-inspect</code>. To extract raw sequences:</p>
<pre><code>centrifuge-inspect &lt;centrifuge index&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Extract the sequence ID to taxonomy ID conversion table from the index</p>
<pre><code>centrifuge-inspect --conversion-table &lt;centrifuge index&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Extract the taxonomy tree from the index:</p>
<pre><code>centrifuge-inspect --taxonomy-tree &lt;centrifuge index&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Extract the lengths of the sequences from the index (each row has two columns: taxonomic ID and length):</p>
<pre><code>centrifuge-inspect --size-table &lt;centrifuge index&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Extract the names from the index (each row has two columns: taxonomic ID and name):</p>
<pre><code>centrifuge-inspect --name-table &lt;centrifuge index&gt;</code></pre>
<h2 id="wrapper">Wrapper</h2>
<p>The <code>centrifuge</code>, <code>centrifuge-build</code> and <code>centrifuge-inspect</code> executables are actually wrapper scripts that call binary programs as appropriate. Also, the <code>centrifuge</code> wrapper provides some key functionality, like the ability to handle compressed inputs, and the functionality for [<code>--un</code>], [<code>--al</code>] and related options.</p>
<p>It is recommended that you always run the centrifuge wrappers and not run the binaries directly.</p>

    --n-ceil <func>

</td><td>

Sets a function governing the maximum number of ambiguous characters (usually
`N`s and/or `.`s) allowed in a read as a function of read length.  For instance,
specifying `-L,0,0.15` sets the N-ceiling function `f` to `f(x) = 0 + 0.15 * x`,
where x is the read length.  See also: [setting function options].  Reads
exceeding this ceiling are [filtered out].  Default: `L,0,0.15`.

</td><td>

When calculating a mismatch penalty, always consider the quality value at the
mismatched position to be the highest possible, regardless of the actual value. 
I.e. input is treated as though all quality values are high.  This is also the
default behavior when the input doesn't specify quality values (e.g. in [`-f`],
[`-r`], or [`-c`] modes).

<tr><td id="centrifuge-options-nofw">

[`--nofw`]: #centrifuge-options-nofw

    --nofw/--norc

</td><td>

If `--nofw` is specified, `centrifuge` will not attempt to align unpaired reads to
the forward (Watson) reference strand.  If `--norc` is specified, `centrifuge` will
not attempt to align unpaired reads against the reverse-complement (Crick)
reference strand. In paired-end mode, `--nofw` and `--norc` pertain to the
fragments; i.e. specifying `--nofw` causes `centrifuge` to explore only those
paired-end configurations corresponding to fragments from the reverse-complement
(Crick) strand.  Default: both strands enabled.

a candidate paired-end alignment where mate 1 appears upstream of the reverse
complement of mate 2 and the fragment length constraints ([`-I`] and [`-X`]) are
met, that alignment is valid.  Also, if mate 2 appears upstream of the reverse
complement of mate 1 and all other constraints are met, that too is valid.
`--rf` likewise requires that an upstream mate1 be reverse-complemented and a
downstream mate2 be forward-oriented. ` --ff` requires both an upstream mate 1

This means that if two reads are identical (same name, same nucleotides, same qualities) Centrifuge will find and report the same classification(s) for both, even if there was ambiguity. When <code>--non-deterministic</code> is specified, Centrifuge re-initializes its pseudo-random generator for each read using the current time. This means that Centrifuge will not necessarily report the same classification for two identical reads.

<h1 id="the-centrifuge-build-indexer">The <code>centrifuge-build</code> indexer</h1>
<p><code>centrifuge-build</code> builds a Centrifuge index from a set of DNA sequences. <code>centrifuge-build</code> outputs a set of 6 files with suffixes <code>.1.cf</code>, <code>.2.cf</code>, and <code>.3.cf</code>. These files together constitute the index: they are all that is needed to align reads to that reference. The original sequence FASTA files are no longer used by Centrifuge once the index is built.</p>
<p>Use of Karkkainen's <a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1314852">blockwise algorithm</a> allows <code>centrifuge-build</code> to trade off between running time and memory usage. <code>centrifuge-build</code> has two options governing how it makes this trade: <a href="#centrifuge-build-options-bmax"><code>--bmax</code></a>/<a href="#centrifuge-build-options-bmaxdivn"><code>--bmaxdivn</code></a>, and <a href="#centrifuge-build-options-dcv"><code>--dcv</code></a>.

This behavior can be disabled using the <a href="#centrifuge-build-options-a"><code>-a</code>/<code>--noauto</code></a> option.</p>
<p>The indexer provides options pertaining to the &quot;shape&quot; of the index, e.g. <a href="#centrifuge-build-options-o"><code>--offrate</code></a> governs the fraction of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrows-Wheeler_transform">Burrows-Wheeler</a> rows that are &quot;marked&quot; (i.e., the density of the suffix-array sample; see the original <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FM-index">FM Index</a> paper for details). All of these options are potentially profitable trade-offs depending on the application. They have been set to defaults that are reasonable for most cases according to our experiments. See <a href="#performance-tuning">Performance tuning</a> for details.</p>
<p>The Centrifuge index is based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FM-index">FM Index</a> of Ferragina and Manzini, which in turn is based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrows-Wheeler_transform">Burrows-Wheeler</a> transform.

<h1 id="getting-started-with-centrifuge">Getting started with Centrifuge</h1>
<p>Centrifuge comes with some example files to get you started. The example files are not scientifically significant; these files will simply let you start running Centrifuge and downstream tools right away.</p>
<p>First follow the manual instructions to <a href="#obtaining-centrifuge">obtain Centrifuge</a>. Set the <code>CENTRIFUGE_HOME</code> environment variable to point to the new Centrifuge directory containing the <code>centrifuge</code>, <code>centrifuge-build</code> and <code>centrifuge-inspect</code> binaries. This is important, as the <code>CENTRIFUGE_HOME</code> variable is used in the commands below to refer to that directory.</p>
<h2 id="indexing-a-reference-genome">Indexing a reference genome</h2>
<p>To create an index for two small sequences included with Centrifuge, create a new temporary directory (it doesn't matter where), change into that directory, and run:</p>
<pre><code>$CENTRIFUGE_HOME/centrifuge-build --conversion-table $CENTRIFUGE_HOME/example/reference/gi_to_tid.dmp --taxonomy-tree $CENTRIFUGE_HOME/example/reference/nodes.dmp --name-table $CENTRIFUGE_HOME/example/reference/names.dmp $CENTRIFUGE_HOME/example/reference/test.fa test</code></pre>
<p>The command should print many lines of output then quit. When the command completes, the current directory will contain ten new files that all start with <code>test</code> and end with <code>.1.cf</code>, <code>.2.cf</code>, <code>.3.cf</code>. These files constitute the index - you're done!</p>
<p>You can use <code>centrifuge-build</code> to create an index for a set of FASTA files obtained from any source, including sites such as <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway">UCSC</a>, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/genome">NCBI</a>, and <a href="http://www.ensembl.org/">Ensembl</a>. When indexing multiple FASTA files, specify all the files using commas to separate file names. For more details on how to create an index with <code>centrifuge-build</code>, see the <a href="#the-centrifuge-build-indexer">manual section on index building</a>. You may also want to bypass this process by obtaining a pre-built index.</p>
<h2 id="classifying-example-reads">Classifying example reads</h2>
<p>Stay in the directory created in the previous step, which now contains the <code>test</code> index files. Next, run:</p>
<pre><code>$CENTRIFUGE_HOME/centrifuge -f -x test $CENTRIFUGE_HOME/example/reads/input.fa</code></pre>
<p>This runs the Centrifuge classifier, which classifies a set of unpaired reads to the the genomes using the index generated in the previous step. The classification results are reported to stdout, and a short classification summary is written to centrifuge-species_report.tsv.</p>
<p>You will see something like this:</p>
